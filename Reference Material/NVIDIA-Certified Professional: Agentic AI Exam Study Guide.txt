NVIDIA-Certified Professional | Agentic AI Exam Study Guide | 1
This study guide provides an overview of each topic covered on the NVIDIA-Certified Professional: Agentic AI certification exam,
recommended training, and suggested reading to prepare for the exam.
Job Description
The agentic AI professional is an intermediate practitioner adept at designing, evaluating, and deploying autonomous AI systems.
Responsibilities include constructing resilient, secure, and trustworthy agentic solutions such as customer/employee assistants,
automated meeting companions, and productivity tools (e.g., content generation, analytics). The candidate must master agentic
AI architecture fundamentals—including reactive, deliberative, and hybrid systems—and excel in goal-oriented reasoning, chain-
of-thought prompt engineering, and tool orchestration with robust error handling.
Expertise includes memory management (short- and long-term context), evaluation frameworks, deployment of containerized
workflows, monitoring/logging, ethical safeguards (e.g., bias detection, privacy preservation, guardrails), troubleshooting
hallucinations, tracing failures, and managing stateful orchestration for complex, multi-turn tasks. They combine generative AI
and reasoning systems knowledge with MLOps workflow deployment and GPU-optimized operations to ensure scalable, ethical
implementation.
Key Responsibilities
1. End-to-end agent development exposure
2. Model and framework selection and integration
3. Agent structure and tool creation
4. Orchestration of agent workflows
5. Assessment, evaluation, and iterative improvement
Recommended Qualifications and Experience
1. 2-3 years in AI and machine learning roles
2. Experience with production-level agentic AI projects (e.g., chatbots, workflow automation)
